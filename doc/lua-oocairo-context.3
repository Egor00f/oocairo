.IX Header "Name"
lua-oocairo-context \- Drawing context objects
.SH "Introduction"
.IX Header "Introduction"
A context object is used to perform all the drawing operations on a
Cairo surface.  Context objects can be created by calling the
\&\f(CW\*(C`context_create\*(C'\fR function in the module table returned from \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR
and passing in a surface object.
.SH "Methods"
.IX Header "Methods"
The following methods are available on context objects:
.IP "cr:append_path (path)" 4
.IX Item "cr:append_path (path)"
Add the path instructions from \fIpath\fR to the current path of \fIcr\fR.
The \fIpath\fR value should be an object returned from the \f(CW\*(C`cr:copy_path()\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`cr:copy_path_flat()\*(C'\fR method.
.IP "cr:arc (cx, cy, radius, angle1, angle2)" 4
.IX Item "cr:arc (cx, cy, radius, angle1, angle2)"
Add a curved segment to the current path which approximates a section
of a circle centered at point (\fIcx\fR,\ \fIcy\fR) with a radius of \fIradius\fR.
The two angles determine which part of the circle to draw.  They are both
measured in radians.  For a complete circle \fIangle1\fR should be zero, and
\&\fIangle2\fR should be 2pi.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    \-\- Draw a complete circle.
\&    local PI = 2 * math.asin(1)
\&    local x, y, radius = 50, 100, 23
\&    cr:arc(x, y, radius, 0, 2 * PI)
\&    cr:stroke()
.Ve
.Sp
All five arguments to the method must be numbers.
.Sp
A straight line will be added to the path from the current point to the
start of the arc, if there is a current point.  To avoid this, call
\&\f(CW\*(C`cr:new_sub_path()\*(C'\fR before adding the arc.
.IP "cr:arc_negative (cx, cy, radius, angle1, angle2)" 4
.IX Item "cr:arc_negative (cx, cy, radius, angle1, angle2)"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:arc()\*(C'\fR, but goes the opposite way round the circle.
.IP "cr:clip ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:clip ()"
From now on clip anything outside the current path, preventing it from
being drawn, and then discard the path.
.IP "cr:clip_extents ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:clip_extents ()"
Returns four numbers in two pairs, the \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR coordinates of the
corners of a rectangle which encloses the area of the surface where drawing
can still take place when clipping is taken in to account.
.IP "cr:clip_preserve ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:clip_preserve ()"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:clip()\*(C'\fR but keeps the current path.
.IP "cr:close_path ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:close_path ()"
Add a straight line segment to the path from the current point to the
point where the path started from (the first \f(CW\*(C`cr:move_to()\*(C'\fR position.
.IP "cr:copy_path ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:copy_path ()"
Returns an object containing details of the instructions which define
the current path on \fIcr\fR at the time this is called, as defined by any
calls to methods like \f(CW\*(C`cr:move_to()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`cr:line_to()\*(C'\fR made so far.
The return value can be passed to \f(CW\*(C`cr:append_path()\*(C'\fR.  See
\&\fIlua\-oocairo\-path\fR\|(3) for details about what else can be done with
a path object.
.IP "cr:copy_path_flat ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:copy_path_flat ()"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:copy_path()\*(C'\fR except that the path returned will not contain

(\fIx\fR,\ \fIy\fR), with the control points (\fIc1x\fR,\ \fIc1y\fR) and
(\fIc2x\fR,\ \fIc2y\fR).  All six arguments must be numbers.
.IP "cr:device_to_user (x, y)" 4

Returns four numbers giving two corners of the rectangular area which would
be affected by a call to \f(CW\*(C`cr:fill()\*(C'\fR with the current path.
.IP "cr:fill_preserve ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:fill_preserve ()"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:fill()\*(C'\fR but the current path is left intact for use in
further drawing operations.
.IP "cr:font_extents ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:font_extents ()"
Return a table containing metrics for the currently selected font at its
current size, in user-space coordinates (so \fInot\fR scaled etc. according to

.IP "cr:glyph_extents (glyphs)" 4
.IX Item "cr:glyph_extents (glyphs)"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:text_extents()\*(C'\fR, but instead of a string, the \fIglyphs\fR value
should be table in the format accepted by \f(CW\*(C`cr:show_glyphs()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "cr:glyph_path (glyphs)" 4
.IX Item "cr:glyph_path (glyphs)"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:text_path()\*(C'\fR, but instead of string takes a table of glyphs
like \f(CW\*(C`cr:show_glyphs()\*(C'\fR.
.IP "cr:has_current_point ()" 4

.IX Item "cr:mask (pattern)"
.PD 0
.IP "cr:mask (surface, x, y)" 4
.IX Item "cr:mask (surface, x, y)"
.PD
Both of these set a mask which will be used to filter all drawing.  The
parts of the mask which are transparent will still be drawn, but the opaque
parts will not be, and semitransparent pixels work proportionately.
.Sp
This method will accept either a pattern object or a surface object,
just as for the \f(CW\*(C`cr:set_source()\*(C'\fR method.
.Sp
The mask only has an alpha channel, so any colour information in the
pattern or surface is ignored.

with the \f(CW\*(C`cr:arc()\*(C'\fR method.
.IP "cr:paint ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:paint ()"

as filling a rectangle enclosing the whole area of the surface.
.IP "cr:paint_with_alpha (alpha)" 4
.IX Item "cr:paint_with_alpha (alpha)"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:paint()\*(C'\fR except the source is blended at the proportion given
by \fIalpha\fR.  An alpha value of one means complete opacity (same as
\&\f(CW\*(C`cr:paint()\*(C'\fR), and zero means complete transparency (no effect).

.IX Item "cr:path_extents ()"
Returns four numbers giving two corners of the rectangular bounding box
of the current path.
.IP "cr:pop_group ()" 4

.IP "cr:push_group ([content])" 4
.IX Item "cr:push_group ([content])"
Begin drawing on a new temporary surface.  If \fIcontent\fR is specified
then it can limit what the temporary surface can store.  It should be
one of the values accepted by the \f(CW\*(C`surface_create_similar\*(C'\fR function
defined in the module table (see \fIlua\-oocairo\fR\|(3)).
.IP "cr:rectangle (x, y, width, height)" 4
.IX Item "cr:rectangle (x, y, width, height)"
Add the outline of a rectangle to the current path.  All four arguments
must be numbers.  The rectangle path will be closed at the end.

.IX Item "cr:rel_curve_to (c1x, c1y, c2x, c2y, x, y)"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:curve_to()\*(C'\fR but with coordinates relative to the current point.
.IP "cr:rel_line_to (x, y)" 4
.IX Item "cr:rel_line_to (x, y)"

.PD
Set the source to a ready-made pattern object, or to a surface object with
the given offset.  Setting a pattern object is useful for applying a gradient.
Setting a surface is useful for drawing the contents of one surface onto
another.  The \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR values indicate what position on \fIsurface\fR
should be drawn at the origin.
.IP "cr:set_source_gdk_color (c, [alpha])" 4
.IX Item "cr:set_source_gdk_color (c, [alpha])"
Set the source to a solid colour given by a GdkColor value from the
Lua-Gnome library, and optionally an alpha value using the same range
of numbers.  This method is exactly the same as calling \f(CW\*(C`set_source_rgb\*(C'\fR
(or \f(CW\*(C`set_source_rgba\*(C'\fR if \fIalpha\fR is present), except that the red,
green, and blue components are retrieved from \fIc\fR by treating it as a
table, and all the numbers are treated as 16\ bit unsigned integers
and scaled to the range used by Cairo.
.Sp
If present and not nil, the opacity value \fIalpha\fR must be a number and
is expected to range from 0 for fully transparent to 0xFFFF (65535) for
completely opaque.
.Sp
See the example program \fIgtk\-drawing.lua\fR for one use of this method
in setting a source colour and opacity from a GtkColorButton widget.

.PD 0
.IP "cr:set_source_pixmap (pixmap, x, y)" 4
.IX Item "cr:set_source_pixmap (pixmap, x, y)"
.PD
Set the source to an image given as a Gdk object.  The value of \fIpixbuf\fR
must be a GdkPixbuf object from the Lua-Gnome library, and that of \fIpixmap\fR
must be a GdkPixmap object.
.Sp
The \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR coordinates are the same as in \f(CW\*(C`cr:set_source()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Usually, you'll want to use \f(CW\*(C`set_source_pixbuf\*(C'\fR, because pixbufs can
include transparency information.
.Sp
See example program \fIgtk\-image.lua\fR for an example of how to use these
methods.
.IP "cr:set_source_rgb (r, g, b)" 4
.IX Item "cr:set_source_rgb (r, g, b)"
Set the source to a solid colour.  The three values must be numbers from
zero to one.
.IP "cr:set_source_rgba (r, g, b, a)" 4
.IX Item "cr:set_source_rgba (r, g, b, a)"
Set the source to a solid colour with a level of opacity.  The four values
must be numbers from zero to one.  A value of one for \fIa\fR indicates full
opacity.
.IP "cr:set_tolerance (tolerance)" 4
.IX Item "cr:set_tolerance (tolerance)"
Set a number which determines how finely curves are spliced up into straight
lines before being drawn.  Higher numbers can increase the quality of the
output in some situations, but will slow down rendering.
.IP "cr:show_glyphs (glyphs)" 4
.IX Item "cr:show_glyphs (glyphs)"
Draw glyphs from a font, but instead of specifying a string of characters,
this method expects the caller to have already worked out which glyphs in
the current font to use, and the exact positions at which they should be
placed.  The \fIglyphs\fR value should be a table containing an array of
tables, each of which should contain three numbers:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
The index number of the glyph.  The exact meaning of this depends on
which font is selected.
.IP "2." 4
The \fIx\fR coordinate at which to draw the glyph on the surface.
.IP "3." 4
The \fIy\fR coordinate.

.IP "cr:show_text (text)" 4
.IX Item "cr:show_text (text)"
Draw the text given in the string \fItext\fR (which must be encoded as
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0), using the current font face and size, and the current source.
This draws immediately, it doesn't leave a path for further drawing.
See the \f(CW\*(C`cr:text_path()\*(C'\fR method for drawing outlined text.
.IP "cr:show_text_glyphs (text, glyphs, clusters)" 4
.IX Item "cr:show_text_glyphs (text, glyphs, clusters)"
Draw the glyphs given by the \fIglyphs\fR table, in the same way as the
\&\f(CW\*(C`cr:show_glyphs()\*(C'\fR method, but if the surface supports it, store the
correspondence between the glyphs and the characters in the \s-1UTF\-8\s0
string \fItext\fR represented by \fIclusters\fR.
.Sp
The clusters value must be a table.  It may contain a key called \f(CW\*(C`backward\*(C'\fR,
whose value will be a boolean value, true if the clusters are listed in
reverse order.  It should also contain an array part containing pairs
of values; that is, the \fIclusters\fR entries with keys starting with the
number one should each be a table containing two numbers, a number of bytes
in the \fItext\fR string and a number of glyphs in the \fIglyphs\fR array, which
are meant to correspond to each other.
.Sp
Only available with Cairo\ 1.8 or better.
.IP "cr:stroke ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:stroke ()"
Draw a line along the current path using colour from the current source,
with other settings such line width taken in to account.
.IP "cr:stroke_extents ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:stroke_extents ()"
Returns four numbers giving two corners of the rectangular area which would
be affected by a call to \f(CW\*(C`cr:stroke()\*(C'\fR with the current path.
.IP "cr:stroke_preserve ()" 4
.IX Item "cr:stroke_preserve ()"
Same as \f(CW\*(C`cr:stroke()\*(C'\fR but the current path is left intact for use in
further drawing operations.
.IP "cr:text_extents (text)" 4
.IX Item "cr:text_extents (text)"
Returns a table of metrics describing the how the text in the string \fItext\fR
will appear when rendered with the current font.  The table will contain
the following keys:
